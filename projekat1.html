			<p>
			Liverpool is ahead for a title after 30 years.
			Almost everyone that this is the season,
			and maybe this is the best way to end 
			the bad tradition of 30 years without league title.
			Liverpool are still first, and they maintain 
			the points difference of 8 points 
			ahead of the second places Leicester,
			and 9 points ahead of the third
			Manchester City.
			The next match Liverpool will play
			against Brighton & Hove Albion and 
			they have a chance to continue the 
			winning streak.

			<h2>For Ibrahimović age is just a number</h2>
			<img class="photo-post" src="ibra.jpg">
			<p>
			After serious injury before 2 years 
			everyone said that Ibrahimović's 
			career is over. Everyone except
			him. After end of his Manchester
			United journey and move to LA Galaxy.
			For most of us it was a sign that
			his career is over, but he said 
			that the end is when he said it is.
			Now over his American part of career
			and 56 goals and 17 assists he proved 
			that we all were wrong.
			Now he is a step ahead of a next 
			european destination and a real test
			for him, but for sure,
			the end is when he said it is.
